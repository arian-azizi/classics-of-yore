                In October of 1958, before even the inception of <i>Pong</i>, the game <i>Tennis for Two</i> was created by William Higginbotham using a simple oscilloscope and vacuum tube analog computer.
                On that fateful day, a new means of entertainment was born. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since that important milestone, video games have grown into a monolithic industry that generates hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue each year.
                Even more vitally however, video games have enabled billions of people around the world to explore new worlds, revel in core gameplay loops, and intervene in tales just as epic as any film or novel.
                A legacy of evolution and revolution, from the dawn of arcades to the great video game crash of 1983, from the humble beginnings of Nintendo's NES to the unrivaled rise of PlayStation, video games have shaped how many of us experience the world and furthermore have given us countless hours of joy, heartache, excitement, and catharsis.

                <br>
                We invite you to take this journey with us as we recount some of the most important and influential games in the history of the medium.
                Some heralded as masterpieces, others largely forgotten by the passage of time, let us go forth and explore the classics of yore.
