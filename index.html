                    On October 18<sup>th</sup>, 1958, long before the inception of <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, <i>Pac-Man</i>, or even <i>Pong</i>, a program known as <i>Tennis for Two</i> was created by William Higginbotham using a simple oscilloscope and vacuum tube analog computer.
                    On that fateful day, a new means of entertainment was born. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since that important milestone, video games have grown into a monolithic multi-billion dollar industry that employs thousands.
                    Even more significantly however, video games have enabled people around the world to interact with new worlds and characters, revel in core gameplay loops, and intervene in tales just as epic as any film or novel.
                    A legacy of evolution and revolution, from the dawn of arcades to the great video game crash of 1983 to the mainstream resurgence that has made "Pikachu" a household name, video games have shaped how many of us experience the world.
                    They have given us countless hours of joy, heartache, excitement, and catharsis, and provided us with many lifetimes worth of discovery.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We invite you to take this journey with us as we recount some of the most important and influential games in the history of the medium.
                    From huge AAA blockbusters to smaller indie projects, from the humble beginnings of Nintendo's NES to the unrivaled rise of PlayStation, from Shigeru Miyamoto to Hideo Kojima, and from 8-bit pixel platformers to bleeding-edge narrative-driven RPGs, video games remain the most diverse medium on our planet.
                    Some heralded as masterpieces, others largely forgotten by the passage of time, let us go forth and explore the classics of yore.
